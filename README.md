# Goodreads Scraper 

![Scraping Goodreads lists](Media/Book.jpg)

### Getting ready 

* Download Python 3 and an IDE. I used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and recommend you to do too as it is easier to manage the environment  
* Install the necessary packages (Use pip and I have provided a couple of examples of the syntax you could run in the CLI to accomplish the same)

```sh
$ pip install BeautifulSoup
$ pip install requests
```

### Input and Output

**Input** - The URL of the list which you want to scrape 
**Output**- A CSV containing information about the books that are featuring in the list 

### Approach 

* Use the list URL and get the title and url of the books that are present in the list. You can define how many pages in the list you would want to scrape as well 
* Each book URL is then parsed using BeautifulSoup in order to extract the required information
* This is then appended to a pandas dataframe which is then downloaded as a CSV file locally

|   0  |   The Devil in the White City           |   Erik Larson       |   Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed AmericaErik Larson's gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America's rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair's brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country's most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his "World's Fair Hotel" just west of the fairgrounds—a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.The Devil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. In this book the smoke, romance, and mystery of the Gilded Age come alive as never before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |   502876       |   4.00        |   {'non-fiction': 9245, 'history': 6245, 'true-crime': 2719, 'crime': 1062}                                         |   non-fiction  |   history          |   447        |   9780739303405  |   https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/21996.The_Devil_in_the_White_City        |
|   1  |   Freakonomics                          |   Steven D. Levitt  |   Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)  |   690871       |   3.98        |   {'non-fiction': 10281, 'economics': 4387, 'business': 2137, 'science': 1155, 'psychology': 820}                   |   non-fiction  |   economics        |   320        |   9780061234002  |   https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/1202.Freakonomics                        |
|   2  |   A Short History of Nearly Everything  |   Bill Bryson       |   In Bryson's biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   286412       |   4.21        |   {'non-fiction': 8162, 'science': 6014, 'history': 4686, 'audiobook': 500}                                         |   non-fiction  |   science          |   544        |   9780767908184  |   https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything  |
|   3  |   Guns, Germs, and Steel                |   Jared Diamond     |   "Diamond has written a book of remarkable scope ... one of the most important and readable works on the human past published in recent years."Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and a national bestseller: the global account of the rise of civilization that is also a stunning refutation of ideas of human development based on race.In this "artful, informative, and delightful" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed writing, technology, government, and organized religion—as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war—and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science, the Rhone-Poulenc Prize, and the Commonwealth Club of California's Gold Medal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |   286005       |   4.03        |   {'history': 8510, 'non-fiction': 7251, 'science': 2521, 'anthropology': 1071, 'sociology': 540, 'politics': 383}  |   history      |   non-fiction      |   425        |   9780739467350  |   https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel                |
|   4  |   Outliers                              |   Malcolm Gladwell  |   In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   531685       |   4.16        |   {'non-fiction': 8936, 'psychology': 2495, 'business': 2267, 'self-help': 1025, 'sociology': 765}                  |   non-fiction  |   psychology       |   309        |   9780316017923  |   https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/3228917-outliers                         |
